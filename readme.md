# **Anushke Portfolio** - T1A2

## **Project Description**
I am creating a personal web portfolio to showcase my skills and knowledge in HTML and CSS. I have created the web portfolio to reflect who I am. The website includes relevant information on my journey to becoming a software developers. It also includes projects (still to be added) and blog posts on things I have found interesting in the 'Coding World'. I will be using the mobile first approach and then scaling to tablet and desktop formats

## **Inspirations**
Doing alot of research was key to building this website the way I liked it. Its abit daunting starting a project from scratch. I found that a quick search of 'software dev portfolio' in google popped up quite a few interesting results. Only issue was that many were using JS and other frameworks. I found that many of the websites (excluding animations and effects) shared something in common - they were simple and modern. Using this theme and combining different aspects of websites I liked, I started designing in Figma. Please see the below list of website I recommend checking out:
- https://leerob.io/ - Lee Robinson
- https://anniebombanie.com/#home - Annie Liew
- https://brittanychiang.com/ - Brittany Chiang
- https://olaolu.dev/ - Olaolu
  
Youtube was also a good source of inspiration. I particulaly found two channels really useful - Online Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers) and Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/kepowob). I actually got the tile inspiration from Online Tutorials (they really know there CSS animations). 



## **Designing**
Before coding - starts the designing and planning process. Inital wireframing and planning for the website was done through Figma and Figjam. I also built the sitemap through figjam, to understand how all the pages were going to come together. Please see below for the sitemap, basic schematics and wireframes.

 ### *Sitemap*

 #### *Desktop Wireframe*

Even though using a wireframe is really useful, I found that it was only really good for positioning elements on a website. When intially designing and constructing the website, I was going for more of a pixel theme. This usese more lighter colors, but for some reason, it felt abit too 'empty'. Once I started using a dark background and brighter colours for the accents, the website looked more complete. Animations are also quite hard to plan and show on a wireframe. I intially left the space empty and the anaimations were added last to the website, with most of the inspiration coming from youtube  

All graphical components have also been designed by me using applications such as Asesprite and Pixaki (which took a while!). This includes all the logo, social logo's and gifs. 

 ## **Functionality & Features**
The main point of navigation to the other webpages is through the navigation bar found on the top. The logo is also a 'return to home' button. The navigation bar includes navigation to 4 different main webpages that links to other webpages. The navigation menu includes:
- About Me
- Projects
- Blog
- Contact (button)

The hover and highlight function have also been used to give the user feedback while navigating through the menu or though the blog and projects main pages.   

## **Pages**
