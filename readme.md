# **Anushke Portfolio** - T1A2

## **Project Description**
I am creating a personal web portfolio to showcase my skills and knowledge in HTML and CSS. The website includes relevant information on my journey to becoming a full stack software developer. It also includes projects (still to be added) and blog posts on things I have found interesting while on my coding journey. I will be using the mobile first approach and then scaling to tablet and desktop format

## **Inspirations**
Doing alot of research was key to building this website the way I wanted it be presented. Its abit daunting starting a project from scratch. I found that a quick search of 'software dev portfolio' in google popped up quite a few interesting results. The only issue was that many sites were using JS and other frameworks. I found that many of the websites (excluding animations and effects) all shared something in common - they were simple and all had a modern design. Using this theme and combining different aspects from the websites I liked, I started designing in Figma. Please see the below list of website I recommend checking out:
- https://leerob.io/ - Lee Robinson
- https://anniebombanie.com/#home - Annie Liew
- https://brittanychiang.com/ - Brittany Chiang
- https://olaolu.dev/ - Olaolu
  
Youtube was also a good source of inspiration. I particulaly found two channels really useful - Online Tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers) and Kevin Powell (https://www.youtube.com/kepowob). I actually got the tile inspiration from Online Tutorials (they really know there CSS animations). 

## **Target Audience**
This is for anyone that is interested in my CSS and HTML skills or for just getting to know me. This could be for either future employers or inspiration for anyone interested in creating a persoanl web portfolio

## **Designing**
Before coding - I started the designing and planning process. Inital wireframing and planning for the website was done through Figma and Figjam. I also built the sitemap through Figjam, to understand how all the pages were going to come together. Please see below for the sitemap, basic schematics and wireframes.

 ### *Sitemap*

 #### *Desktop Wireframe*

When intially designing and constructing the website, I was going for more of a pixel theme. This uses more of a lighter theme of colours, but for some reason the end result didnt look so good. Once changed to a darker background while using brighter colours as the accents, the website to me looked better. Animations were also quite hard to plan and show on the wireframes. I intially left the space empty and the animations were added later to the website, with most of the help and inspiration coming from youtube and other web developer sites  

All the graphical components have been designed by using applications such as Asesprite and Pixaki (which took a while and alot of thought!). This includes all the logo and gifs. 

 ## **Functionality & Features**
Navigation to the other webpages is done through the navigation bar found on the top of the webpage. The logo is also a 'return to home' button. The navigation bar includes navigation to the 4 other main webpages that links to other webpages (in projects and blogs). The navigation menu includes:
- About Me
- Projects
- Blog
- Contact (button)

The hover and highlight function have also been used to give the user feedback while navigating through other links.   

## **Pages**
Please see the below for a description of each webpage

### **Home Page**
The homepage is the main page for the website and is what the user will first see upon entering the website. A mission statement and and introduction to the website is also included in the website.

### **About Me**
The user will find information about my background in this page. This page includes a slideshow with images and also a 'typing' animation. Srolling down the page, the main text content is found. Also a copy of my resume can be downloaded by clicking the resume image. Desktop format is also quite different to mobile and tablet format - this is due to vertical format leaving wide side bars in  desktop format.

## **Future Updates**
In future updates, I will like to add JS to the website to make it more responsive. Also I would like to add support for more screen resolutions - the website becomes abit finicky between the tablet and desktop resolutions. The projects will also be added in a future update with more blogs. Keep tuned!
